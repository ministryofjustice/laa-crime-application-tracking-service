This is a Java 21 based Spring Boot application hosted on [MOJ Cloud Platform](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/concepts/about-the-cloud-platform.html).

### Obtaining environment variables for running locally
 
To run the app locally, you will need to download the appropriate environment variables from the team vault in 1Password. These environment variables are stored as a .env file, which docker-compose uses when starting up the service. If you don't see the team vault, speak to your tech lead to get access.

To begin with, make sure that you have the 1Password CLI installed:

```sh
op --version
```

If the command is not found, [follow the steps on the 1Password developer docs to get the CLI set-up](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/).

Once you're ready to run the application:

```sh
./start-local.sh
```

### Decrypting values files

The values YAML files are encrypted using [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt).

To be able to view and/or edit these files, you will need to decrypt them first.

You will first need to create a GPG key. See [Create a GPG Key](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/create-a-gpg-key.html) for details on how to do this with `GPGTools` (GUI) or `gpg` (command line).
You can install either from a terminal or just download the UI version.

```
brew update
brew install gpg
brew install git-crypt
```

Once you have done this, a team member who already has access can add your key by running `git-crypt add-gpg-user USER_ID`\* and creating a pull request to this repo.

Once this has been merged you can decrypt your local copy of the repository by running `git-crypt unlock`.

\*`USER_ID` can be your key ID, a full fingerprint, an email address, or anything else that uniquely identifies a public key to GPG (see "HOW TO SPECIFY A USER ID" in the gpg man page).
The apps should then startup cleanly if you run

### Application Set up

Clone Repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/laa-crime-application-tracking-service.git

cd crime-application-tracking
```

Make sure all tests are passed by running following ‘gradle’ Command

```sh
./gradlew clean test
```

You will need to build the artifacts for the source code, using `gradle`.

```sh
./gradlew clean build
```

```sh
./start-local.sh
```

laa-crime-application-tracking-service application will be running on http://localhost:8490

### Metrics and Health Check endpoints

There are a number of out of the box endpoints provided by Spring Boot for verifying application health and various metrics, some of which are enabled and accessible.

These endpoints include:

- http://localhost:8500/actuator
- http://localhost:8500/actuator/prometheus
- http://localhost:8500/actuator/health
- http://localhost:8500/actuator/info
- http://localhost:8500/actuator/metrics
- http://localhost:8088/api-docs (generated by `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui` with URL path defined in `application.yaml` by `springdoc.api-docs.path: /api-docs`)

For a complete list of all out of the box actuator endpoints see [Spring Boot 3.2.3 - Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.1.5/reference/html/actuator.html#actuator).
